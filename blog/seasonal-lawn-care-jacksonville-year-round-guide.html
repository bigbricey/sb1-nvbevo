        <h3>Quick Guide Summary</h3>
        <p>In Jacksonville, lawn care varies by season: Spring (fertilize, control weeds, adjust mower height), Summer (water early morning, watch for pests, maintain higher mowing height), Fall (overseed cool-season grasses, apply pre-emergent, reduce watering), Winter (monitor for frost damage, reduce mowing, control winter weeds). St. Augustine and other warm-season grasses dominate our region and require specific seasonal care approaches.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Understanding Jacksonville's Unique Lawn Care Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Jacksonville's climate presents both advantages and challenges for lawn maintenance. With mild winters, hot summers, and a long growing season, our Northeast Florida location requires a specialized approach to lawn care that differs significantly from other parts of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our region falls within USDA Hardiness Zones 8b-9a, characterized by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High humidity and rainfall during summer months</li>
          <li>Periodic drought conditions, especially in spring</li>
          <li>Occasional winter freezes that can damage warm-season grasses</li>
          <li>Sandy soils with rapid drainage and poor nutrient retention</li>
          <li>Extended growing season from March through November</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This comprehensive guide will walk you through season-by-season lawn care practices specifically tailored to Jacksonville's unique growing conditions. Whether you have St. Augustine, Bermuda, Zoysia, or Bahia grass, these recommendations will help you maintain a lush, healthy lawn year-round.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Centipede</td>
            <td>Medium-textured, light green, slow growth</td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Low-maintenance areas, acidic soils</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>
          St. Augustine (particularly the Floratam variety) is the most common grass type in Jacksonville residential lawns due to its adaptation to our climate and attractive appearance. However, each type has specific seasonal care requirements that we'll address throughout this guide.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
          <h4>Pro Tip: Know Your Grass</h4>
          <p>Not sure what type of grass you have? Take a close-up photo of your lawn showing individual grass blades and bring it to a local garden center or contact the UF/IFAS Extension Duval County office for identification. Proper identification ensures you can provide the right care for your specific grass type.</p>

        <h3>Spring Lawn Care (March-May)</h3>
        <div class="seasonal-content">
          <p>
            Spring is a crucial period for Jacksonville lawns as warm-season grasses emerge from dormancy and begin active growth. This is the time to set your lawn up for success throughout the growing season.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Key Spring Tasks for Jacksonville Lawns</h4>
          <ul class="task-list">
            <li><strong>Soil Testing:</strong> Conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to check pH and nutrient levels. Jacksonville's sandy soils often need amendments.</li>
            <li><strong>Green-Up Fertilization:</strong> Apply the first fertilizer of the season when grass shows consistent new growth (usually mid-March to early April).</li>
            <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Apply pre-emergent herbicide in early spring to prevent summer annual weeds. Spot-treat existing winter weeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrigation System Check:</strong> Inspect and repair irrigation systems before the hot season. Check coverage and adjust sprinkler heads.</li>
            <li><strong>Mowing Height Adjustment:</strong> Begin regular mowing when grass actively grows, following these height guidelines:
              <ul>
                <li>St. Augustine: 3.5-4 inches</li>
                <li>Bermuda: 1-1.5 inches</li>
                <li>Zoysia: 2-2.5 inches</li>
                <li>Bahia: 3-4 inches</li>
                <li>Centipede: 1.5-2 inches</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Thatch Management:</strong> If thatch exceeds 1/2 inch, consider dethatching when grass is actively growing.</li>
            <li><strong>New Sod Installation:</strong> Spring is an excellent time for sod installation in Jacksonville.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Spring Fertilization Guide</h4>
          <p>
            The first fertilization of the year is critical for proper green-up. For most Jacksonville lawns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply a complete fertilizer with a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (N-P-K) ratio like 16-4-8 or similar</li>
            <li>Look for products containing slow-release nitrogen and micronutrients like iron, manganese, and zinc</li>
            <li>For St. Augustine and Bermuda: Apply 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet</li>
            <li>For Zoysia, Bahia, and Centipede: Apply 0.5 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Important Note on Fertilizer Ordinances</h4>
            <p>Jacksonville has fertilizer ordinances that restrict application during certain periods. Avoid fertilizing before heavy rain and always follow package directions. Never apply fertilizer within 10 feet of any water body, and use zero-phosphorus fertilizers unless a soil test indicates phosphorus deficiency.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h4>Spring Watering Guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            As temperatures rise, adjust your watering schedule:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Water 1-2 times per week in early spring, increasing as temperatures rise</li>
            <li>Apply 1/2-3/4 inch of water per irrigation session</li>
            <li>Water in early morning (before 10 AM) to reduce evaporation and fungal disease risk</li>
            <li>Adjust based on rainfall – skip irrigation if you receive 1/2 inch or more of rain</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="tool-recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Tools for Spring Lawn Care:</strong> Soil test kit, broadcast spreader for fertilizer application, pre-emergent herbicide, sharp mower blades, rain gauge to monitor water application.</p>

        <h3>Summer Lawn Care (June-September)</h3>
        <div class="seasonal-content">
          <p>
            Summer in Jacksonville brings intense heat, humidity, and heavy rainfall, creating ideal conditions for robust growth but also increasing pest and disease pressure. This is the peak growing season for warm-season grasses.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Key Summer Tasks for Jacksonville Lawns</h4>
          <ul class="task-list">
            <li><strong>Proper Mowing Practices:</strong> Maintain slightly higher mowing heights in summer to promote drought tolerance and deeper root growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer Fertilization:</strong> Apply a summer-formulated fertilizer in June or early July with appropriate N-P-K ratio for your grass type.</li>
            <li><strong>Pest Monitoring and Control:</strong> Watch for signs of chinch bugs (in St. Augustine), armyworms, and sod webworms. Treat promptly when detected.</li>
            <li><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Monitor for signs of brown patch, gray leaf spot, and take-all root rot, especially during periods of high humidity.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Watering:</strong> Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth and drought tolerance.</li>
            <li><strong>Iron Application:</strong> Consider applying iron supplements if your lawn shows yellowing but is otherwise healthy.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Water 2-3 times per week (observe water restrictions if in effect)</li>
            <li>Apply 3/4-1 inch of water per irrigation session</li>
            <li>Water between 4-8 AM to minimize evaporation and disease</li>
            <li>Look for signs of drought stress: folded leaf blades, blue-gray color, footprints remaining visible</li>
            <li>Consider hand-watering persistently dry spots rather than increasing overall irrigation</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Managing Summer Lawn Diseases</h4>
          <p>
            Jacksonville's humidity creates ideal conditions for fungal diseases, especially in St. Augustine lawns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Brown Patch (Large Patch):</strong> Circular brown areas with a yellow halo; treat with fungicides containing azoxystrobin or propiconazole</li>
            <li><strong>Gray Leaf Spot:</strong> Gray-brown spots on leaf blades that expand to irregular patches; reduce nitrogen and apply appropriate fungicides</li>
            <li><strong>Take-All Root Rot:</strong> Yellowing that progresses to brown, thin patches; improve drainage and soil pH</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Summer Fertilizer Caution</h4>
            <p>Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers during peak summer heat, as they can increase disease susceptibility and burn the lawn. If applying summer fertilizer, choose a slow-release formula and apply during a cooler period.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tool-recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Tools for Summer Lawn Care:</strong> Rain gauge, soil moisture meter, hose-end sprayer for insecticide application, fungicide for disease control, sharp mower blades (replace or sharpen monthly during summer).</p>

        <h3>Fall Lawn Care (October-November)</h3>
        <div class="seasonal-content">
          <p>
            Fall in Jacksonville brings cooler temperatures but still allows for significant growth of warm-season grasses. This season is crucial for preparing your lawn for winter and setting the stage for next year's success.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Key Fall Tasks for Jacksonville Lawns</h4>
          <ul class="task-list">
            <li><strong>Fall Fertilization:</strong> Apply a fall-specific fertilizer with less nitrogen and more potassium to improve cold hardiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Apply pre-emergent herbicide to prevent winter annual weeds. Spot-treat existing weeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce Mowing Frequency:</strong> As growth slows, reduce mowing frequency but maintain proper height.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Irrigation:</strong> Reduce watering frequency as temperatures cool and days shorten.</li>
            <li><strong>Overseed (optional):</strong> Consider overseeding Bermuda or Bahia lawns with annual ryegrass for winter color, if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Testing:</strong> Fall is a good time for soil testing if you didn't test in spring.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Fall Fertilization Guide</h4>
          <p>
            Fall fertilization helps prepare your lawn for winter stress:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply a fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio like 8-0-24 or similar (higher potassium, lower nitrogen)</li>
            <li>Timing: Mid-October to early November</li>
            <li>For St. Augustine and Bermuda: Apply 0.5-0.7 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet</li>
            <li>For Zoysia, Bahia, and Centipede: Apply 0.5 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet</li>
            <li>Look for fertilizers containing iron to maintain color without excessive growth</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>To Overseed or Not?</h4>
          <p>
            Overseeding with cool-season grass (typically annual ryegrass) provides winter color but has pros and cons for Jacksonville lawns:
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Pros</th>
              <th>Cons</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Green color throughout winter</td>
              <td>Competes with warm-season grass for nutrients and water</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Reduces winter weed pressure</td>
              <td>Can delay spring green-up of permanent grass</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Prevents soil erosion</td>
              <td>Requires additional mowing through winter</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Provides actively growing surface for winter</td>
              <td>Adds watering needs during normally dormant period</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> In Jacksonville, overseeding is usually unnecessary for home lawns. St. Augustine, our most common grass type, generally stays reasonably green through winter and does not overseed well. Bermuda lawns can be overseeded if winter color is desired, but this practice is more common for golf courses and sports fields than residential properties.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Fall Weed Control Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            Fall is the ideal time to prevent winter weeds in Jacksonville lawns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply pre-emergent herbicide in mid-October to prevent winter annuals like annual bluegrass (Poa annua) and henbit</li>
            <li>Use products containing prodiamine, dithiopyr, or pendimethalin</li>
            <li>Water in pre-emergent products with 1/4-1/2 inch of irrigation</li>
            <li>For existing weeds, spot-treat with appropriate post-emergent herbicides while weeds are actively growing</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Fall Lawn Recovery Tip</h4>
            <p>Fall is an excellent time to address thin spots in your lawn. For small areas, St. Augustine can be encouraged to fill in by applying a thin layer of compost and ensuring adequate water. For larger bare spots, sodding is more effective than seeding for most Jacksonville lawn types.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h4>Fall Watering Guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            Adjust your irrigation as temperatures cool:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce to once or twice per week by late October</li>
            <li>Apply 1/2-3/4 inch of water per irrigation session</li>
            <li>Water in the early morning to reduce disease risk</li>
            <li>Consider turning off irrigation system and watering manually during winter months</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="tool-recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Tools for Fall Lawn Care:</strong> Broadcast spreader for fertilizer and pre-emergent herbicides, soil test kit, core aerator for compacted soils, leaf rake or mulching mower for managing fallen leaves.</p>

        <h3>Winter Lawn Care (December-February)</h3>
        <div class="seasonal-content">
          <p>
            Winter in Jacksonville is mild compared to most of the country, but cold snaps can still impact warm-season grasses. This is a period of minimal maintenance, but attention to a few key practices will ensure your lawn emerges healthy in spring.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Key Winter Tasks for Jacksonville Lawns</h4>
          <ul class="task-list">
            <li><strong>Minimize Traffic:</strong> Limit walking on dormant or semi-dormant grass, especially during frost.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Frost Management:</strong> Avoid walking on frosted grass as it can cause damage to leaf blades.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Mowing:</strong> Mow only as needed, typically every 3-4 weeks for St. Augustine in winter.</li>
            <li><strong>Winter Weed Control:</strong> Spot-treat winter weeds as they appear.</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment Maintenance:</strong> Service lawn equipment during this slower season.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrigation Management:</strong> Reduce watering significantly, only irrigating during extended dry periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Fertilization:</strong> Do not apply fertilizer during winter months.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Managing Winter Color Changes</h4>
          <p>
            In Jacksonville, winter lawn appearance varies by grass type:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>St. Augustine:</strong> Usually maintains some green color but grows very slowly; may turn yellowish-brown during cold periods</li>
            <li><strong>Bermuda:</strong> Typically goes dormant (turns brown) with first frost</li>
            <li><strong>Zoysia:</strong> Usually goes dormant or semi-dormant, turning tawny brown</li>
            <li><strong>Bahia and Centipede:</strong> Become dormant or semi-dormant with colder temperatures</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            This dormancy or semi-dormancy is <strong>normal and healthy</strong>. Resist the urge to fertilize to "green up" your lawn in winter, as this can damage the grass and make it more susceptible to cold injury.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Frost Protection Strategies</h4>
          <p>
            Jacksonville typically experiences several frosts each winter. To minimize damage:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When frost is predicted, water the lawn the day before (moist soil holds heat better than dry soil)</li>
            <li>Avoid walking on or mowing frosted grass</li>
            <li>Do not fertilize before anticipated frost events</li>
            <li>For newly installed sod or particularly valuable areas, consider covering with frost cloth if severe cold is predicted</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Winter Irrigation Tip</h4>
            <p>Most Jacksonville lawns need minimal irrigation during winter. If no significant rainfall occurs for 2-3 weeks and temperatures are above 40°F, apply approximately 1/2 inch of water. Using a rain gauge or moisture meter can help determine if irrigation is necessary.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h4>Winter Weed Control</h4>
          <p>
            Winter annual weeds are opportunistic in dormant lawns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Common winter weeds in Jacksonville include annual bluegrass, chickweed, henbit, and lawn burweed</li>
            <li>Spot-treat with selective post-emergent herbicides labeled for your grass type</li>
            <li>Apply herbicides when temperatures are above 50°F for several days</li>
            <li>Hand-pull isolated weeds when soil is moist</li>
            <li>Avoid blanket applications of herbicides on dormant lawns</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>After-Frost Caution</h4>
            <p>After a hard freeze, resist the urge to "clean up" damaged grass by mowing or raking. The browned leaf blades actually help protect the growing points of the grass. Wait until spring green-up before removing damaged foliage.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h4>Winter Lawn Equipment Maintenance</h4>
          <p>
            Use the winter slowdown to prepare equipment for the upcoming growing season:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sharpen mower blades</li>
            <li>Change oil and air filters</li>
            <li>Empty old fuel or add fuel stabilizer</li>
            <li>Clean and lubricate moving parts</li>
            <li>Repair or replace damaged equipment components</li>
            <li>Check irrigation system for leaks or damage</li>
            <li>Calibrate spreaders for spring applications</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="tool-recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Tools for Winter Lawn Care:</strong> Targeted weed control products, frost cloth for sensitive areas, rain gauge to monitor winter precipitation, moisture meter to determine irrigation needs.</p>

        <h2>Special Considerations for Different Grass Types</h2>
        <p>
          Each type of grass common in Jacksonville has unique seasonal needs. Here are specific considerations for the most popular varieties:
        </p>
        
        <h3>St. Augustine-Specific Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Apply iron supplements to enhance green color; higher mowing height (3.5-4") prevents weed pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Monitor closely for chinch bugs, especially in sunny areas; maintain higher mowing height</li>
          <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Apply potassium-rich fertilizer to increase cold hardiness; do not overseed</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Minimal irrigation; spot-treat for broadleaf weeds; expect some browning during cold spells</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bermuda-Specific Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Scalp the lawn as it breaks dormancy (one-time mowing at 1" or less); higher nitrogen needs</li>
          <li><strong>Summer:</strong> More frequent mowing (every 5-7 days); higher water needs during drought</li>
          <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Can be overseeded with ryegrass for winter color; apply pre-emergent for winter weed control</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Will go dormant (brown) with frost; minimal maintenance needed during dormancy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Zoysia-Specific Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Can be dethatched or verticut as it greens up; moderate fertilizer needs</li>
          <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Excellent drought tolerance once established; water deeply but less frequently</li>
          <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Apply potassium to enhance winter hardiness; generally not overseeded</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Usually goes dormant with frost; good cold tolerance; minimal maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bahia-Specific Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Low fertilizer needs; control broadleaf weeds as they emerge</li>
          <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Highly drought tolerant; mow at 3-4 inches; seedheads are common</li>
          <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Minimal fertilization needed; good natural winter hardiness</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Usually goes dormant; excellent cold tolerance; minimal care needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
          <h4>Mixed Grass Lawns</h4>
          <p>Many Jacksonville lawns contain a mix of grass types, especially St. Augustine with patches of Bermuda or Bahia. In these cases, follow the maintenance schedule for the predominant grass type, but be aware that herbicide tolerance varies between species. Always check product labels for compatibility with all grass types in your lawn.</p>

        <h2>Sustainable Lawn Care Practices for Jacksonville</h2>
        <p>
          Maintaining a beautiful lawn while protecting Jacksonville's fragile ecosystem is possible with these sustainable practices:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Water Conservation Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Install Smart Irrigation Controller:</strong> Weather-based systems adjust watering based on local conditions</li>
          <li><strong>Use Rain Sensors:</strong> Prevents irrigation when sufficient rainfall has occurred</li>
          <li><strong>Implement Rain Barrels:</strong> Capture rainwater for hand-watering dry spots</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Deep, Infrequent Watering:</strong> Encourages deeper root systems for better drought tolerance</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust Sprinkler Heads:</strong> Prevent watering sidewalks, driveways, and roads</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Reducing Chemical Inputs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</strong> Monitor for problems and treat only when necessary</li>
          <li><strong>Apply Compost Tea:</strong> Enhances soil biology naturally</li>
          <li><strong>Try Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Slow-release nutrients with less environmental impact</li>
          <li><strong>Incorporate Microclover:</strong> In Bermuda or Bahia lawns to naturally add nitrogen</li>
          <li><strong>Hand-Pull Weeds:</strong> When feasible, especially in smaller lawns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Building Soil Health</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy soil is the foundation of a sustainable lawn:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Topdress with Compost:</strong> Apply a thin layer (¼ inch) annually to add organic matter</li>
          <li><strong>Leave Grass Clippings:</strong> Returns nutrients and organic matter to soil</li>
          <li><strong>Aerate Compacted Soils:</strong> Improves root growth and water penetration</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain Proper pH:</strong> Most Jacksonville lawns benefit from lime application every few years</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage Beneficial Organisms:</strong> Reduce pesticide use to support earthworms and beneficial microbes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
          <h4>Waterway Protection</h4>
          <p>Jacksonville is intersected by the St. Johns River and numerous tributaries. Never apply fertilizers or pesticides before heavy rain, and maintain at least a 10-foot buffer between application areas and any water body. Remember that everything applied to your lawn can eventually reach our waterways.</p>
