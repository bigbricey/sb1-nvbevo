              Frequently Asked Questions About Sod Installation in Jacksonville

              items={[
                {
                  question: "How long does it take for newly installed sod to root in Jacksonville?",
                  answer: "In Jacksonville's climate, new sod typically begins rooting within 10-14 days during the growing season (March-October). Complete root establishment usually takes 4-6 weeks for St. Augustine and similar timeframes for other varieties. Our aftercare guidance helps ensure optimal rooting conditions specific to Northeast Florida's climate."
                },
                {
                  question: "How often should I water new sod in Jacksonville?",
                  answer: "For the first 10-14 days after installation in Jacksonville, water your new sod 2-3 times daily for about 15-20 minutes per session, ideally in the early morning and mid-afternoon. After roots begin establishing, reduce to once daily for the next week, then transition to 2-3 times weekly. This schedule may need adjustment based on Jacksonville's rainfall patterns and summer heat."
                },
                {
                  question: "What is the best sod variety for Jacksonville homes?",
                  answer: "St. Augustine Floratam is the most popular choice for Jacksonville homes due to its excellent adaptation to our climate, tolerance to both sun and partial shade, and beautiful appearance. However, the best variety depends on your specific property conditions. Zoysia is excellent for drought resistance, while Bermuda works well for high-traffic areas. We provide personalized recommendations based on your yard's specific conditions."
                },
                {
                  question: "Can you install sod over my existing lawn?",
                  answer: "We don't recommend installing new sod over existing grass. Our process involves completely removing the old lawn with a sod cutter, hauling away the debris, and then installing fresh sod on the cleared ground. This approach prevents issues with root competition, uneven growth, and disease transfer that can occur when new sod is laid over old grass."
                },
                {
                  question: "How long should I stay off newly installed sod?",
                  answer: "We recommend minimizing foot traffic on newly installed sod in Jacksonville for at least 2-3 weeks. This allows the roots to properly establish in our local soil conditions. After that initial period, light traffic is acceptable, but wait 4-6 weeks before resuming normal lawn activities or placing furniture on the new grass."
