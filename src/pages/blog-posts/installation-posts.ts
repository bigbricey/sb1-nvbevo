        <h3>1. Soil Testing</h3>
        <p>Start by testing your soil to understand its composition and nutrient levels.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Jacksonville's sandy soils often require amendments for optimal grass growth.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Collect soil samples from various areas of your yard</li>
          <li>Send samples to a local extension office or use a home testing kit</li>
          <li>Analyze results for pH levels and nutrient deficiencies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Remove Existing Grass and Weeds</h3>
        <p>Clear the area of all existing vegetation.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Eliminates competition for your new sod and prevents weed growth.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a sod cutter to remove old grass</li>
          <li>Apply a non-selective herbicide for stubborn weeds (follow local regulations)</li>
          <li>Remove all debris, including rocks and large roots</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Grade the Soil</h3>
        <p>Ensure proper slope and drainage across your yard.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Prevents water pooling and ensures even growth.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a rake or small tractor to level the area</li>
          <li>Ensure a slight slope away from buildings (about 1-2% grade)</li>
          <li>Fill in low spots and remove high spots</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Improve Soil Quality</h3>
        <p>Amend the soil based on your soil test results.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Provides essential nutrients and improves soil structure for healthy grass growth.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Add organic matter like compost to improve soil structure</li>
          <li>Incorporate lime if soil is too acidic (common in Jacksonville)</li>
          <li>Add fertilizer based on soil test recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Tilling and Smoothing</h3>
        <p>Loosen and smooth the soil surface.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Creates an ideal seedbed for sod roots to establish quickly.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>

          <li>Till the soil to a depth of 4-6 inches</li>
          <li>Remove any additional debris that surfaces</li>
          <li>Smooth the area with a lawn roller or rake</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6. Final Grading</h3>
        <p>Perform a final grade to ensure a perfectly smooth surface.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Creates an even, attractive lawn surface.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>

          <li>Check for and fill any remaining low spots</li>
          <li>Ensure proper slope for drainage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7. Soil Compaction</h3>
        <p>Lightly compact the soil to create a firm surface.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Prevents settling after sod installation.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a lawn roller filled 1/3 with water</li>
          <li>Roll in different directions to ensure even compaction</li>
          <li>Avoid over-compacting, which can hinder root growth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>8. Pre-Installation Watering</h3>
        <p>Moisten the soil before sod installation.</p>
        <strong>Why it's important:</strong> Provides immediate moisture for sod roots and helps cool the soil.
        <strong>How to do it:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Water the area lightly the day before installation</li>
          <li>Ensure soil is moist but not muddy</li>
        </ul>
