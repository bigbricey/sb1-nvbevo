<div class="section">
  <h2>Drought Resistance Features to Look For</h2>
  <p>
    When selecting drought-resistant sod for your Jacksonville lawn, look for these key characteristics:
  </p>
  
  <h3>Deep Root Systems</h3>
  <p>
    Grasses with deep root systems can access moisture further in the soil profile, making them more resilient during dry periods. Bermuda and Zoysia grasses typically develop deeper roots than St. Augustine.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Low Evapotranspiration Rates</h3>
  <p>
    Some grass varieties naturally lose less water through their leaves. Zoysia and Bermuda grasses have lower evapotranspiration rates, meaning they require less water to stay healthy.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Dormancy Capabilities</h3>
  <p>
    Grasses that can enter dormancy during drought and then recover quickly when water becomes available are ideal for Jacksonville's occasional dry spells. Bermuda and Bahia excel in this regard.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Heat Tolerance</h3>
  <p>
    Drought resistance often correlates with heat tolerance. All the varieties mentioned above handle Jacksonville's hot summers well, reducing stress during the most water-intensive months.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Water Requirements Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the water needs of different sod varieties can help you make an informed decision. Here's how they compare in Jacksonville's climate:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Traditional St. Augustine (Floratam):</strong> 1-1.5 inches of water per week during growing season</li>
    <li><strong>Zoysia:</strong> 0.5-1 inch of water per week once established</li>
    <li><strong>Bermuda:</strong> 0.5-0.75 inches of water per week once established</li>
    <li><strong>Bahia:</strong> 0.25-0.5 inches of water per week once established</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Note: These are general guidelines. Actual water requirements depend on specific soil conditions, sun exposure, and seasonal weather patterns. All new sod requires more frequent watering during the establishment period (typically 2-3 weeks).
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Establishment and Transition Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    When switching to a drought-resistant sod variety, keep these factors in mind:
  </p>
  
  <h3>Initial Watering Needs</h3>
  <p>
    All new sod, even drought-resistant varieties, requires consistent moisture during the establishment period. Plan to water new sod daily for the first 2-3 weeks, regardless of variety.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Transition Period</h3>
  <p>
    When replacing an existing lawn with drought-resistant sod, proper removal of the old grass and soil preparation are crucial. This ensures the new sod can establish its deep root system effectively.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Seasonal Timing</h3>
  <p>
    For drought-resistant varieties in Jacksonville:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best Time to Install:</strong> Late spring through early summer (April-June)</li>
    <li><strong>Second-Best Time:</strong> Early fall (September-October)</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Mid-winter installation, as slower growth may delay drought-resistant characteristics</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Maintenance Tips for Drought-Resistant Lawns</h2>
  <p>
    Maximize the drought resistance of your new lawn with these maintenance practices:
  </p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bermuda:</strong> 1-2 inches</li>
    <li><strong>Zoysia:</strong> 1.5-2.5 inches</li>
    <li><strong>Bahia:</strong> 3-4 inches</li>
    <li><strong>St. Augustine (drought-tolerant varieties):</strong> 3.5-4 inches</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Deep, Infrequent Watering</h3>
  <p>
    Once established, water deeply but infrequently to encourage deeper root growth. This typically means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Watering 1-2 times per week during growing season</li>
    <li>Applying 0.5-0.75 inches of water per session</li>
    <li>Watering in early morning (before 10 AM)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Soil Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Enhance your soil's water retention capabilities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add organic matter to sandy Jacksonville soils</li>
    <li>Apply compost as a top dressing annually</li>
    <li>Consider soil penetrants for compacted areas</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Fertilization Practices</h3>
  <p>
    Proper fertilization supports drought resistance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use slow-release nitrogen sources</li>
    <li>Include potassium to enhance drought tolerance</li>
    <li>Reduce fertilizer applications during drought periods</li>
    <li>Follow a seasonal fertilization schedule appropriate for your grass type</li>
  </ul>
