        <h2>Installation Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the best time to install sod?</h3>
          <p>The best time to install sod is during the cooler months of spring and fall when temperatures are mild. This allows the grass to establish strong roots before facing extreme weather conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I install sod myself?</h3>
          <p>While it's possible to install sod yourself, hiring professionals ensures proper installation and better results. Professional installation includes proper soil preparation, precise cutting, and expert placement for optimal growth.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does it take for sod to root?</h3>
          <p>Sod typically takes 2-3 weeks to establish roots, depending on weather conditions and care. During this time, proper watering and minimal foot traffic are crucial for successful establishment.</p>

        <h2>Maintenance Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How often should I water my new sod?</h3>
          <p>New sod should be watered daily for the first two weeks, then gradually reduce to every other day. The soil should remain moist but not waterlogged. Morning watering is recommended for best results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What type of sod is best for shaded areas?</h3>
          <p>For shaded areas, consider using a shade-tolerant sod variety like Zoysia or St. Augustine. These varieties can thrive with as little as 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>When can I mow my new sod?</h3>
          <p>Wait at least 2-3 weeks after installation before the first mowing. This allows the roots to establish properly. When you do mow, ensure the grass is at least 3 inches tall.</p>
