## Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the Jax Sod blog content strategy. It outlines the technical implementation, content guidelines, SEO best practices, and topic ideas for creating high-quality, traffic-driving blog posts focused on landscaping and lawn care in Florida, particularly the Jacksonville area.

## Technical Implementation

### Blog Post Structure

Blog posts are organized into category-based files to improve maintainability:

1. **File Structure:**
   - `src/data/blog-posts/general-educational-posts.ts` - General lawn education content
   - `src/data/blog-posts/grass-types-posts.ts` - Posts about different grass varieties
   - `src/data/blog-posts/installation-posts.ts` - Sod installation guides
   - `src/data/blog-posts/maintenance-posts.ts` - Lawn care and maintenance tips
   - `src/data/blog-posts/index.ts` - Combines all categories into a single array

2. **Adding New Categories:**
   - Create a new file in `src/data/blog-posts/` following the naming pattern
   - Export an array of blog posts with the appropriate type
   - Import and include the new category in `index.ts`

### Blog Post Format

Each blog post must include the following properties:

```typescript
{
  id: number,           // Unique identifier (increment from highest existing ID)
  title: string,        // SEO-optimized title
  slug: string,         // URL-friendly version of title (kebab-case)
  excerpt: string,      // Brief summary (150-160 characters ideal for SEO)
  content: string,      // Full HTML content of the post
  date: string,         // Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  author: string        // Author name (typically "Jax Sod Team")
}
```

### Content Format Guidelines

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Use semantic HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, etc.)
   - Include only one `<h1>` tag per post (the main title)
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
   - Use `<strong>` for emphasis on important points

2. **Quick Answer Section:**
   - Begin most posts with a "Quick Answer" section that provides immediate value
   - Format using:
   ```html
   <div class="quick-answer">
     <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
     <p>Concise answer to the main question (2-3 sentences).</p>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Content Sections:**
   - Organize content into logical sections using:
   ```html
   <div class="section">
     <h2>Section Title</h2>
     <!-- Section content -->
   </div>
   ```

4. **Lists and Tables:**
   - Use unordered lists (`<ul>`) for non-sequential items
   - Use ordered lists (`<ol>`) for sequential steps or ranked items
   - Use tables for comparing options or presenting structured data
